## :grey_question: Why Software

I've always loved the endless possiblities with being able to code. From making a script in python to help with an automated task to being able to tweak and change a game I enjoy playing. I love the creativity behind it, the endless opportunity to learn and the ability to create something out of nothing. Software Engineering has been a passion for me since the age of 11 and whether professionally or not I'll be coding for years to come.
